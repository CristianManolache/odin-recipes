    <p>
        To prepare <strong>spaghetti carbonara</strong> start by putting a pot of salted water on the burner to cook the
        pasta. In the
        meantime, remove the pork rind from the guanciale <font color="red">(1)</font> and cut it first into slices and
        then into
        strips about 1/2"
        (1cm) <font color="red">(2)</font> thick. The removed rind can be reused to flavor other things. Put the pieces
        into a non-stick pan <font color="red">(3)</font> and
        brown for about 15 minutes over medium heat, being careful not to burn it or it will smell too strong.

        Meanwhile, put spaghetti in boiling water <font color="red">(4)</font> and cook for the time indicated on the
        package. In the meantime,
        pour the yolks into a bowl <font color="red">(5)</font>, add most of the Pecorino cheese needed for the recipe
        and the remaining part will
        be used just before serving.

        Season with black pepper <font color="red">(7)</font> and whip by hand <font color="red">(8)</font>. Add a
        tablespoon of cooking water to dilute the mixture and stir
        <font color="red">(9)</font>.

        In the meantime the guanciale will be cooked, turn off the burner and set it aside <font color="red">(10)</font>
        .
        Drain the pasta al dente
        directly into the pan with the guanciale <font color="red">(11)</font> and stir it briefly to season it. Remove
        from heat and pour the
        mixture of eggs and pecorino cheese <font color="red">(12)</font>into the pan. Mix quickly to combine.

        To make it very creamy, if necessary, you can add a little cooking water to your pasta <font color="red">(13)
        </font>. Serve spaghetti
        carbonara immediately with the remaining pecorino cheese <font color="red">(14)</font> and ground black pepper
        <font color="red">(15)</font> on top.

    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>
        What can you add to spaghetti carbonara? First of all, respecting your taste in the kitchen is always very
        important! If you're still not sure, here are some very good alternatives. For example, as an alternative to
        spaghetti you can also use rigatoni or mezze maniche pasta, and instead of the guanciale, try bacon strips with
        oil or butter. Or replace the pecorino cheese or mix it with grated parmesan cheese. And finally, to make your
        carbonara even more creamier, there will be no need to add cream! You can simply add a little cooking water to
        the pasta or use a combination of whole eggs and yolks: try to find the consistency you prefer! We used
        spaghetti No. 3, but you can also try spaghetti No. 5 and Spaghettoni pasta!</p>
