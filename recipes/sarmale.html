    <h1>Romanian Cabbage Rolls</h1>
    <p>
        Here’s my mom’s recipe for traditional <strong>Romanian Cabbage Rolls (Sarmale)</strong> which I’ve been making
        for decades.
        <br>They’re stuffed with pork and rice and baked with lots of bacon in between. They’re the best cabbage rolls
        you
        will ever have!
    </p>

        This recipe for Romanian cabbage rolls is tried and true. I’ve made it probably a hundred times, and have rolled
        thousands of them! The big difference between Romanian cabbage rolls and others are that we make them with sour
        cabbage.
        <br>You can find sour cabbage at pretty much all grocery stores sold in jars. You can also find sour
        cabbage at your local Polish or Ukrainian stores!

        <br>The beauty of using sour cabbage is that you don’t need to boil cabbage or freeze it to soften the leaves.
        So
        basically there’s very minimal work in prepping the cabbage leaves. But besides that, cabbage rolls made with
        sour cabbage pack so much more flavor!
        <!-- Find out i can use the b attribute for bold text instead of strong -->
        <br>This is my mom’s recipe for sarmale and it’s my favorite. I won’t eat cabbage rolls made any other way. The
        other piece that separates Romanian cabbage rolls from the rest is that we add some kind of smoked meat. This
        time I used <b>smoked bacon. </b>Now I’ve got your attention, hey?

    <h3>Ingredients you'll need:</h3>
    <br>
    <img src="..//recipes/images/sarmaleimg/sarmaleingredients.jpg" alt="sarmaleingredients">
    <ul>
        <li><b>Vegetable oil: </b>We’ll be using this to saute the onion and rice. You can use any type of oil that you
            have handy.</li>
        <li><b>Onion: </b>I used a large onion because this recipe makes a lot of cabbage rolls. Every bite should have
            a little bit of onion in it!</li>
        <li><b>Long grain rice: </b>I prefer Jasmine or Basmati rice. I wouldn’t use brown rice as it takes a lot longer
            to cook than white rice and you may end up with crunchy bits in your rolls.</li>
        <li><b>Ground pork: </b>I love to use pork because it has a higher fat content and makes for some nice juicy
            rolls. You can use any type of ground meat you like, but keep in mind that leaner meats like chicken or
            turkey will come out drier. You can even combine meats, for example half pork and half beef.</li>
        <li><b>Fresh parsley and dill: </b>Using fresh herbs makes such a big difference in how the flavor develops in
            your rolls!</li>
        <li><b>Salt and pepper: </b>Season the mixture to your own discretion but be careful with the rolls because the
            sour cabbage is quite salty.</li>
        <li><b>Sour cabbage leaves: </b>This is what really sets the Romanian version apart from the rest. The little
            hit of vinegar is to die for! Sour cabbage is basically fermented cabbage, same as sauerkraut but it’s sold
            as whole cabbage instead of chopped.</li>
        <li><b>Bacon: </b>Find yourself a nice thick-cut smoky style of bacon.
        </li>
        <li><b>Tomato juice: </b>his is what our rolls are going to sit and cook in.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Prep The Cabbage</h3>
    <img src="../recipes/images/sarmaleimg/sarmaleprocess1.jpg" alt="sarmaleprocess1">
    <p>
        As I mentioned, there’s very little prep that’s needed to get the cabbage ready for rolling. What I do like to
        do
        is soak the sour cabbage in cold water overnight, but usually I forget and I’ll soak it for about an hour while
        I prep my other ingredients and do other stuff in the kitchen. I do this, to remove some of the salt from the
        cabbage, as it can be quite salty.

        Once the cabbage has soaked in water for a bit, you want to take each leaf and cut some of the core from it.
        However, if you’ve already bought a jar of cabbage leaves, you may not even need to do this. Then I cut each
        leaf in half, since I like to make my cabbage rolls smaller.</p>
    <h3>Prep The Filling</h3>
    <img src="../recipes/images/sarmaleimg/sarmaleprocess2.jpg" alt="sarmaleprocess2">
    <p>
        Another thing that sets our cabbage rolls apart is that we actually cook the onion and the rice for a bit before
        adding it to the meat mixture. So basically you’ll want to sauté the onion in some vegetable oil for about 3
        minutes until softened. Then add the rice and toast it for 1 minute. Let it cool while you get the other
        ingredients ready.</p>
    <img src="../recipes/images/sarmaleimg/sarmaleprocess3.jpg" alt="sarmaleprocess3">
    <p>
        Now, in a large bowl, you’ll want to add the ground pork, salt, pepper, parsley, dill, and the onion mixture.
        Mix
        it well with your hands until well combined. Use the salt sparingly since the cabbage leaves are brined.
    </p>
    <h3>Preheat The Oven</h3>
    <p>
        Now is the time to preheat your oven, so get that going to 375°F (191°C), so that it’s nice and warm when we put
        our cabbage rolls in.
    </p>
    <h3>Make The Rolls</h3>
    <img src="../recipes/images/sarmaleimg/sarmaleprocess4.jpg" alt="sarmaleprocess4">
    <p>
        Fill each leaf with about a ¼ cup of the meat mixture and roll tucking in the ends as you see in the video.
        Repeat with all the remaining meat and cabbage leaves.
    </p>
    <h3>Assemble The Rolls</h3>
    <img src="../recipes/images/sarmaleimg/sarmaleprocess5.jpg" alt="sarmaleprocess5">
    <p>
        If you have any leftover cabbage leaves you’ll want to chop that up and spread some on the bottom of a large
        Dutch oven. Then place the cabbage rolls on the chopped cabbage in a single layer. Next, you’ll want to top with
        bacon, and be generous.
    </p>
    <img src="../recipes/images/sarmaleimg/sarmaleprocess6.jpg" alt="sarmaleprocess6">
    <p>Finish with another layer of cabbage rolls, more bacon and a bit more chopped cabbage. If you like you can also
        season with some ground pepper.
    </p>
    <img src="../recipes/images/sarmaleimg/sarmaleprocess7.jpg" alt="sarmaleprocess7">
    <p>
        Now, you’ll need to pour the tomato juice over the cabbage rolls and add additional water as needed. You want to
        make sure the rolls are completely covered with liquid.
    </p>
    <h3>Bake The Cabbage Rolls</h3>
    <img src="../recipes/images/sarmaleimg/sarmaleprocess8.jpg" alt="sarmaleprocess8">
    <p>
        Cover the Dutch oven with a lid or aluminum foil if your pot doesn’t have a lid and transfer it to the oven.
        Bake for 2 hours, then remove the lid or foil and cook for another 1 to 1.5 hours.
    </p>
    <h2>Can I Make This Recipe With Fresh Cabbage?</h2>
    <p>
        Using sour cabbage is what sets Romanian cabbage rolls apart from the rest. If you can’t find any, then you can
        use fresh cabbage instead.

        Follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Carefully separate the leaves from your head of cabbage. Bring a large and generously salted pot of water to
            a boil, and cook the leaves for about 3 minutes.
        <li>Remove the leaves and let them cool. Cut out the thickest part of each leaf at the bottom by slicing on each
            side of the rib to form a triangle.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
